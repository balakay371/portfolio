As an introductory task, we were required to rotoscope a 3-second video of a toy train moving along a track. Above is my completed rotoscope.
I used Adobe Animate to rotoscope the video, and
I learnt a lot about rotoscoping and how to use Animate. However my rotoscoped video looks very unrefined and badly drawn, as I encountered a lot of problems with the actual drawing, such as trackpad problems and time constraints.

For our final product, we were required to film and rotoscope our own 10-second long video. Above is my completed rotoscope. This task was a lot more enjoyable, as I had become more proficient in Animate and was able to create a video that looked a lot nicer and more refined. We were also encouraged to add something to the video, which made it more challenging and creative.
