<img class="balakay" id="balakay1" src="resources/images/opie/balakay0.png"/>
<p id="introp1">This is the image that I manipulated to create my Julian Opie selfie. It is my SKC profile photo, and the only photo of myself that I could quickly find.</p>

<div id="bk2">
<img class="balakay" id="balakay2" src="resources/images/opie/balakay1.jpg"/>
<p id="introp2">This is my first draft of my Julian Opie selfie, made with Pixlr. It is poorly shaded and the brush size is too big, as I was inexperienced with Digital Manipulation and Pixlr. I quickly realised these problems and made improvements.</p>
    </div>
<div id="bk3">
<img class="balakay" id="balakay3" src="resources/images/opie/balakay3.png"/>
<p id="introp3">This is my final draft of my Julian Opie selfie, made with Pixlr. It looks better than the previous draft, however the shading is still quite abrupt and unnatural. It is also quite pixelated, as Pixlr is obviously not the best program to use for this. By this point, I had run out of time to complete a good-looking Julian Opie selfie. </p>

<p id="hoeckpf">This is my final Digital Manipulation product, created by mixing elements of the four Beth Hoeckel artworks listed above. This was done with Adobe Photoshop. I enjoyed this task as I am now much more confident with Photoshop and have learnt how to use it effectively.</p>
